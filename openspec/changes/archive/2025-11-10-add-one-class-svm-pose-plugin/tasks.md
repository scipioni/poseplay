- [x] 1.3 Add plugin metadata and registration
- [x] 1.4 Integrate with existing plugin system
- [x] 1.5 Add configuration support for SVM parameters and feature extraction
- [x] 1.6 Add training command to pyproject.toml for CSV input

## 2. Testing
- [x] 2.1 Write unit tests for feature extraction functions
- [x] 2.2 Write integration tests for the plugin
